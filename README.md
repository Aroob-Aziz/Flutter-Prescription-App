I worked on a Prescription Application project. It basically generates the prescription reports. Prescription is listed by translating speech into text using mic. The project is coded in flutter that uses dart language specifically. This app provides an ease and accelerate the help for doctors to prescribe medicines. Moreover, reports can be saved in the desired folder.
